# rails_deploy, a Chef cookbook

So to deploy a Rails app we need to push source code, make sure the DB exists or create it, run migrations, precompile assets, install gems, ensure correct Ruby & Bundler version, reload NGINX, restart Rails app server (Puma etc). One can do it with a shell script, which I was doing for some time. But it starts to be complicated when you need to do something conditionally: abort further actions if precompile blew up, or not run migrations if not necessary etc. Or you may need to upgrade the Ruby version. Another dimension of complexity is when you have multiple machines with different projects and each has a slightly different configuration principles. Chef can be of help (i hope).
